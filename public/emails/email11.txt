Don't you agree? There is nothing quite like rain. Like honestly, it makes me smile, it makes me happy, it makes... so many things.So anyway, there were a few people I wanted to mention, Carl McGuire, but before I get carried away with names, check out these ads for things that would bug other people, but you and I have a special relationship so I can send to you because we're cool and I always cut you sweet deals!Cheeseburgers for Carl McGuire
 and grapes without leaves.Well, Carl McGuire that's all I had to share today. I hope you enjoy popcorn because the rain will be coming down for quite a while it looks like.
So pull up a chair!
Sincerely,
Jack
