Don't you agree? There is nothing quite like rain. Like honestly, it makes me smile, it makes me happy, it makes... so many things.And would you look at that? The moon is out!
So anyway, there were a few people I wanted to mention, Perceval, but before I get carried away with names, check out these ads for things that would bug other people, but you and I have a special relationship so I can send to you because we're cool and I always cut you sweet deals!Cheeseburgers for Perceval
 and grapes without leaves.Well, Perceval that's all I had to share today. I hope you enjoy popcorn because the rain will be coming down for quite a while it looks like.
So pull up a chair!
Sincerely,
