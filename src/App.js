/*
instructions:
emails are in plain text and are named ./public/emails/email#.txt
They have a specific format, but if you wanted to add more, please format them the same way. IRL this would be resolved using some kind of query/schema
to run the filter, just click the yellow "FILTER THESE EMAILS!" button
you can play with the sliders to determine the threshold score needed for two emails to be sorted into the same bucket, and the number of similar emails needed to constitute "SPAM"


Note: This is not *exactly* how I would model a real-time system for filtering emails, 
it is definitely constructed with the idea in mind that I have to build the data model first
(because it is starting from scratch) before I can accurately score each email.
For that reason, I have to score/bucketize all emails in one step, 
then once they have been all scored, I go back and assign probability.
In a real-time system, I believe this would be done in more like one step.

However, it is pretty close, and definitely demonstrates how I believe a real spam filter could work. 
Let me know what you think!

Enjoy! If you have any questions, or feedback, please send me an email! matthew.speller@tutanota.com
